Many have lost their source of income and cannot feed their families or provide for their children's education. Without proper protective gear, frontline workers in the health sector and other public services are putting themselves at risk of the virus. And street animals are in distress with little food available and in need of urgent care. This campaign aims to provide basic essentials to combat the widespread suffering due to the COVID crisis.
      
            Our goal is to directly support those in need and help them through this unprecedented catastrophe.</p>
